# Arduino Engineering Kit feedback

Using MATLAB r2019a.

## 2.2.2

* Second screenshot of arduinosetup - received an error when running arduinosetup in MATLAB "fatal error: MKRMotorCarrier.h: No such file or directory". Turned out I needed to install the MKRMotorCarrier library in my Arduino IDE, in Tools...Manage Libraries...

## 2.2.3

* code section 3 (all versions with for loop) - warning due to start(dcm) being called outside loop and then subsequently inside.
* section 4 (first version) - save function used incorrectly - needs brackets and commas
* section 4 (after amending to add filename) - save function shouldn't have quotes around PWMcmdMono and speedMono as these are variables.
